# Risk of bias table
([switch to PICO table](pico-table.md))

## Randomized controlled trials
Based on [Cochrane Handbook](http://handbook.cochrane.org/chapter_8/table_8_5_d_criteria_for_judging_risk_of_bias_in_the_risk_of.htm). Modifications are:
* Selective reporting bias is high risk if trial protocol is not registered.(PMID [26244868](https://pubmed.gov/26244868))
* Incomplete outcome data is unclear risk of Consort diagram is not provided.

**Footnotes:**<br>
\* Attrition bias is 'unclear risk" as Consort flow diagram not provided.<br>
† Selective reporting bias is 'unclear risk" as no original protocol at a online trial registry.<br>
‡ Selection bias is 'high risk' due to a run-in phase prior to the trial.
